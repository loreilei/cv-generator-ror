This is a bit more evolved environment I use to generate a resume. It is a derivated work from https://github.com/loreilei/cv-generator.

The idea is to have an HTML layout (that I created thanks to bootstrap) and a JSON file.

The JSON file contains the information to put in the layout.

I just upload the file and then I get the webpage that I can print (using Chromium).

Feel free to use this for your personal usage.
